					<H1>VIKINGS VS SAXONS</H1>

					<div id="instructionsHeader">A turn-based game where two
						players control
						armies of Vikings
						and Saxons. The objective of
						the game is to destroy the enemy army before they destroy yours.

						<br><br><strong>Here are the instructions for playing the game:</strong>
					</div>
					<div><strong>Who goes first?</strong><br>
						Every soldier will spawn with health between 150 and 175, chosen
						randomly. Which ever army has less total health, plays first.
					</div>

					<div><strong>Rolling dice:</strong><br>
						On your turn, roll 2 dices from 1 to 6. The 2 numbers are then multiplied
						and
						that will be the amount of gold you receive. For example, if you roll a 3 and a 4, you
						receive 12 gold.
						If the 2 dices are the same number, the amount of gold you receive is doubled. For example, if
						you roll a 5 and a 5, you receive 50 gold.
					</div>

					<div><strong>Spending gold:</strong> <br>
						You can choose to spend your gold on attacking the enemy
						army
						or purchasing items from
						the shop. If you don't have enough gold for either, you will have to end your turn.</div>

					<div><strong>Attack:</strong> <br> If you choose to attack, your soldiers will
						start battling the enemy army. The battle ends once all enemy soldiers have been attacked
						once.
						Keep in mind that once you initiate the attack, your turn will end instantly after the
						battle,
						and you will not be able to buy things from the shop untill next turn.
					</div>

					<div><strong>Shop:</strong> <br> If you choose to visit the shop, you can spend your gold on
						healing
						, reinforcements
						or other helpful
						items that will aid you in battle. Once you've purchased your items, you can still choose to
						attack, if you have enough gold.</div>

					<div><strong>Battle:</strong> <br> During battle, the armies will clash on the battlefield,
						soldiers
						will deal damage to each other, based on their damage.</div>

					<div><strong>End of the game:</strong> <br> The game ends when one army is destroyed. The player
						with the remaining
						army wins the game.</div>

				</div>
				<div id="soldiersInstructions">
					<img id="warrior" src="./images/warrior.png" alt="warrior">
					<div><strong>Every solder has:</strong></div>
					<div>Random damage between <strong>15-25</strong></div>
					<div>Critical chance of <strong>5%</strong></div>
					<div>Critical damage of <strong>2.5x</strong></div>
					<div>Block chance of <strong>30%</strong></div>
					<div>If blocking, damage reduction of <strong>20%</strong></div>
					<div>Evasion chance of <strong>5%</strong></div>
					<div>Vikings have a berserk method that doubles their damage and increase evasion by 20%, but
						disables
						their
						block chance, and reduces
						their health by half. This occurs when a Viking drops below <strong>50</strong> health, and
						will double his damage for every turn he stays alive, for a maximum of 2 turns.
					</div>
					<div>Saxons have a <strong>5%</strong> chance on every attack to poison a target which deals 5
						damage over 5 seconds.
